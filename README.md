Introduction
============
The code in this repository converts the signals of the original C64 and Sega Megadrive controllers and emulates USB based joysticks for use on unmodded THEC64Mini and SEGA Megadrive Mini consoles. 

It is meant to be installed on an Arduino compatible SparkFun Pro Micro with a male DB9 connector attached to the digital inputs.

It will also work under Windows/linux with Vice

See change log for history.

The repository also includes designs for a case to be 3D printed, as well as some Windows based tools used during debugging and development.
